            <h2 style = "text-align: center"> Here is the Timeline of Martyr Bhagat Singh :</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>1907</strong> : Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907 to a Sikh family in Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India (now in Pakistan). His family had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the British rule in the country.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1919</strong> : When Bhagat Singh was only 12 years old, he bunked school to visit the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre just hours after thousands of unarmed people had been killed.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1921</strong> : When Bhagat was only 14, he took part in a protest against the killing of a large number of unarmed people at Gurudwara Nankana Sahib.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1922</strong> : Bhagat Singh never liked Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence. After the 1922 Chauri Chaura incident, Singh joined the Young Revolutionary Movement and began to advocate for the violent overthrow of the British Government in India.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1923</strong> : During his college time, Singh won an essay competition set by the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, writing on the problems in Punjab. He also wrote briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi and for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1924</strong> : In 1924 to avoid an arranged marriage, Singh ran away to Cawnpore. In a letter he left behind, he said: "My life has been dedicated to the noblest cause, that of the freedom of the country. Therefore, there is no rest or worldly desire that can lure me now".</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1927</strong> : Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1928</strong> : From May to September 1928, Singh published a series of articles on anarchism in Kirti. He often used pseudonyms such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi for publishing his writings.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1928</strong> : In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, British India, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.[4] They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1929</strong> : He proposed a dramatic act to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) with the intention of gaining massive publicity for their aims.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1929</strong> : On April 8, 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Central Assembly chamber. The bombs were made from low-grade explosives and hence, were designed not to kill.
            In the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 9 April 1929, he stated: "It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived."</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>1931</strong> : Singh was hanged an hour ahead of the official time on March 23, 1931 along with his friends Rajguru and Sukhdev in the Lahore conspiracy case.</li>

        <p><em>"Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name." 
            - <strong>Jawaharlal Nehu</strong>
